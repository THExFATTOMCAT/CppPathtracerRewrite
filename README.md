# CppPathtracerRewrite
The goal of this project is to rewrite and improve an older project CppPathtracer. It's therefore attempted to: 1. Speedup vectorcalculations 2. Improve overall rendering performance 3. Develop a proper random distribution interface

# Code
The commenting of the code is sometimes a bit spare and redundant code might be ramaining from debugging or similar.
Fileorganisation and Projectstructure are at some point non-standard/non-practical.
I will start fixing these issues.

# About
The project was originally developed for Windows, since it was the target platform. But I was also tried to code crossplatform, so this code should be able to compile on linux (with minor changes).
